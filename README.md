# Alfred_Workflows

Some Alfred workflows that I use.

## Make-UUID
This one, well, makes a UUID. Great for all your random string needs

## Bunch-menu
Opens the Brett Terpstra's wonderful menubar app Bunch without using the mouse. Switch computing contexts without leaving the keyboard üëç

## Cleansweep
Quit all the apps except for the ones you always need to have open. Edit applescript element to set your own exclusions.

## Clean up Finder Windows
Runs an applescript to close all Finder windows except for the front one.
